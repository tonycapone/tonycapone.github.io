I recently decided to try out [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting my new site. What's great about Github pages is that it's a service I already use and the site is hosted for you. And with the advent of static site generators, you can trade in things like databases and PHP ( *cough* Wordpress *cough*) for a set of static files, usually formatted in markdown. Any time you make a change, you can regenerate the whole site, usually in less than a second.

I had heard of Jekyll, but the hipster in me wanted to try something newer. Then I came across Hugo. Hugo, as the name implies, is written in Go. Again, this appealed to my inner hipster, who is interested in Go.
